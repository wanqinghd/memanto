"""Idempotent installer for the Claude Code lifecycle hooks.

Registers three hooks in a Claude Code ``settings.json`` (project-local by
default, or ``~/.claude`` with ``--global``):

* ``SessionStart``     -> hooks/session_start.py   (inject profile once)
* ``UserPromptExpansion`` -> hooks/on_prompt.py       (recall + inject per skill)
* ``Stop``             -> hooks/on_stop.py          (async distill + store)

The hook command uses the *current* Python interpreter (``sys.executable``) so
the hooks run with the same environment that has ``memanto`` installed. The
settings file is backed up before modification, and re-running cleanly replaces
our previously-installed entries (matched by the hooks directory path) without
touching anyone else's hooks.

Hook JSON structure follows the official Claude Code hooks reference.
