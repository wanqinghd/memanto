"""UserPromptExpansion hook — dynamic injection before a skill runs.

Fires when the developer submits a prompt, before Claude processes it. If the
prompt invokes a skill (``/tdd``, ``/grill-with-docs``, …), we recall the
memories most relevant to that skill and inject them as ``additionalContext``
so Claude honours past decisions instead of re-asking.

This is what makes the layer *zero-touch*: it works on the real, unmodified
mattpocock skills — no forked ``-with-memory`` variants required.
